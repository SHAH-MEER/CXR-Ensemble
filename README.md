A robust, production-ready application for automated chest X-ray classification using a CNN ensemble (ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNet-B0/B4, and ResNet101). This ensemble approach provides reliable detection of Normal, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis (TB) from chest X-ray images, leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning architectures and extensive evaluation.

## üöÄ Features

- **CNN Ensemble**: Combines ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B4, and ResNet101 for robust multi-class classification.
- **Soft-Voting**: Averages softmax probabilities from all models for improved accuracy and generalization.
- **Gradio Web App**: User-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing results.
- **Extensive Visualizations**: Includes confusion matrices, ROC, and precision-recall curves for all models and the ensemble.
- **Modular & Extensible**: Easily swap in new models or update the ensemble.

## üìù Background & Motivation

Pneumonia and tuberculosis are leading causes of morbidity and mortality, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Timely and accurate diagnosis is often limited by a shortage of trained radiologists. Deep learning, particularly ensemble methods, can automate and improve the reliability of chest X-ray interpretation, supporting clinical decision-making in resource-limited settings.

## üìä Dataset & Preprocessing

- **Dataset**: Curated from the [Pneumonia-TB Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shaikhborhanuddin/pneumonia-tb-dataset), with images labeled as 'Normal', 'Pneumonia', or 'Tuberculosis'.
- **Splits**: Training (90%), validation (10%), and held-out test set, with stratified sampling for class balance.
- **Preprocessing**: Images resized to 224x224, normalized with ImageNet mean/std. Data augmentation (flipping, rotation, affine, blur) applied to training set.

---

## üß† Model Architectures & Training

- **Ensemble Members**: ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B4, ResNet101 (all pretrained on ImageNet).
- **Custom Classifier Head**: Each model's classifier replaced with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with dropout and ReLU activations.
- **Training**: AdamW optimizer, cosine annealing scheduler, early stopping, batch size 32, and fixed random seed for reproducibility.
- **Ensemble Technique**: Soft-voting (averaging softmax probabilities) for final prediction.

---

## üìà Results & Visualizations

- **Best Individual Model Accuracy**: Up to 98.73% on validation, 97.82% on test set.
- **Ensemble Test Accuracy**: **98.05%** (outperforms all single models).
- **Per-Class Metrics**: High precision, recall, and F1-score for all classes, especially TB (F1 = 0.99).
- **Visualizations**: Confusion matrices, ROC, and precision-recall curves for all models and the ensemble (see `model_results/`).

## ‚öñÔ∏è Limitations & Ethical Considerations

- Models trained on public datasets; external clinical validation is needed for real-world deployment.
- Ensemble increases computational requirements, which may limit use in low-resource settings.
- Data privacy, fairness, and bias mitigation are essential for safe clinical use.
- The model is a decision support tool, not a replacement for clinical expertise.
